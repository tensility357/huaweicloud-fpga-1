Use AEI_Regsiter.sh to register an FPGA image with the image management module. After the registration, an ID is assigned to the FPGA image. The ID can be used to query the registration status, and load, delete, and associate the image.

### Preparations

Make the following preparations before the registration:

#### Switch to the project directory where the scripts are stored.


Switch to the **scripts** directory.

For example, for an example project, switch to the `huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/hardware/sdaccel_design/examples/mmult_hls/scripts` directory.

#### Build a project. (If a project has been built, skip this step.)

Run the `sh compile.sh hw` command.

#### Run the registration script.

The format of the **AEI_Register.sh** script is as follows:

Usage:sh AEI_Register.sh -p [dcp_obs_path] -o [log_obs_dir] -n [AEI_name] -d [AEI_Description]

-p specifies the file path of the DCP file stored in the OBS bucket. The value of dcp_obs_path consists of 4 to 128 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, hyphens (-), underscores (_), slashes (/), and periods (.). The value cannot start with a slash (/) and must end with .tar. It cannot be null or start or end with a dot (.).

-o specifies the file directory in the OBS bucket where the log files generated by the background compilation are located. If log_obs_dir is not set or is empty, the directory of the DCP file is used by default.

-n specifies the name (AEI_name) of the FPGA image to be registered. AEI_name is a string of 1 to 64 characters, including letters, digits, underscores (_), and hyphens (-).

-d describes the FPGA image (AEI) to be registered. AEI_Description consists of 0 to 255 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, hyphens (-), underscores (_), periods (.), commas (,), and spaces. The value can be customized by users.

Parameters must be enclosed in quotation marks, for example, sh AEI_Register.sh -p "vu9p/abc.tar" -o "vu9p" -n "ocl-test" -d "ocl-desc".

The **AEI_Register.sh** script is executed successfully if the following output is displayed:

\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#  
Register AEI  
\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#

Success: 200 OK

status: saving

-   "Success: 200 OK" indicates that the **AEI_Register.sh** script is executed successfully. The execution of the **AEI_Register.sh** script does not necessarily mean that the FPGA image is successfully registered. Users need to run query subcommands of fisclient and use the FPGA image ID in the registration command output to check the FPGA image information. If the state of the FPGA image is active, the image is successfully registered. An FPGA image can be loaded only after it is successfully registered.

-   "id: 00005568015e3c87835c0326" indicates the ID of the image to be registered. The ID is assigned by the FPGA image management module, and can be used to query the FPGA image registration and loading status.

-   "status: saving" indicates that the FPGA image is being saved.


**Note:** The **AEI_Register.sh** script will transfer the FPGA logic files generated during the registration to the OBS bucket for image registration. After confirming that the registration is successful, you can manually delete the logical files from the OBS bucket to prevent unnecessary OBS charging.

For example, to register an OCL image, run the following commands:

[root\@ scripts]\# sh AEI_Register.sh -n "ocl-test" -d "ocl-desc"  
fis argument(s) and config file are OK
INFO: OCL Running
