Functions

This SDAccel example implements SDAccel-based simulation and hardware instance execution functions. This section describes the operations of the mmult_hls example. For the operations of vadd_cl and vadd_rtl examples, see this section.

SDAccel HDK Operation Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SDAccel HDK platform serves to complete the compilation and simulation of the development process, and needs to run in the compilation environment. After applying for an SDAccel development environment, log in to a VM. Then, obtain the complete directory of the development suite fp1 from github. Users are advised to store the directory in the **huaweicloud-fpga** directory. This document is based on the **huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/** directory.

### To use the HDK, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the compilation environment for SDAccel development.

##### Note

  The compilation environment must include:  

  fp1 development directory (The configuration part and hardware are mandatory, and other options are optional.)  

  SDx development tool

2.  Configure the license file of EDA.

  Open the `setup.cfg` file in `huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/` and set **XILINX_LIC_SETUP** to the IP address of the license server. Set **FPGA_DEVELOP_MODE="sdx"** and **VIVADO_VER_REQ="2017.4.op"**.

  	FPGA_DEVELOP_MODE="sdx"  
  	VIVADO_VER_REQ="2017.4.op"

    CN North:`XILINX_LIC_SETUP="2100@100.125.1.240:2100@100.125.1.245"`

    CN South:`XILINX_LIC_SETUP="2100@100.125.16.137:2100@100.125.16.138"`

    CN East:`XILINX_LIC_SETUP="2100@100.125.17.108:2100@100.125.17.109"`

##### Note
  *Only user root* has the right to use the Xilinx license file provided by Huawei.

3. Configure the development environment.

  Run the **huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/setup.sh** script to configure the hardware development environment.

  	cd huaweicloud-fpga/fp1
  	export HW_FPGA_DIR=$(pwd)
  	source $HW_FPGA_DIR/setup.sh
##### Note
  For details, see the configuration environment part of the README file in the **huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/** directory.

4. Configure the example.
   ```
   cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/examples/mmult_hls/scripts
   sh compile.sh compile_mode
   ```

##### Notes
   You can use the **– h** parameter to obtain help information in the following steps.  
   *compile_mode* contains three compilation modes:  
   **cpu_em**: cpu simulation mode. **bin_mmult_cpu_emu.xclbin** is generated after the compilation is complete.  
   **hw_em**: hardware simulation mode. **bin_mmult_hw_emu.xclbin** is generated after the compilation is complete.   
   **hw**: hardware compilation mode. **bin_mmult_hw.xclbin** is generated after the compilation is complete.   
   Users can select a compilation mode as required.  
   For details, see [Examples](../hardware/sdaccel_design/examples/mmult_hls/README.md).

5. Simulate the example.

   cpu_em Simulate:

   ```
    cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/examples/mmult_hls/scripts
    sh run.sh emu ../prj/bin/mmult ../prj/bin/bin_mmult_cpu_emu.xclbin
   ```

   hw_em Simulate:

   ```
    cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/examples/mmult_hls/scripts
    sh run.sh emu ../prj/bin/mmult ../prj/bin/bin_mmult_hw_emu.xclbin
   ```

##### Notes

   *host* is the host program generated during compilation (The hardware compilation mode does not support simulation.):  
   mmult_hls example: The host program is mmult.  
   vadd_cl example: The host program is vadd.  
   vadd_rtl example: The host program is host.

   *.xclbin* is the .xclbin file generated during compilation. Different compilation modes correspond to different .xclbin files.  
   If the *compile_mode* is **cpu_em**, select **bin_mmult_cpu_emu.xclbin**.  
   If the *compile_mode* is **hw_em**, select **bin_mmult_hw_emu.xclbin**.  

   Skip this step if the simulation test is not required.

6. Perform the hardware test.

  Generate DCP files.

SDAccel SDK Operation Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SDAccel SDK platform is used to test hardware. Compile and run the host program in the execution environment. This section uses mmult_hls as an example to describe the operations.

1.  Go to the execution environment for SDAccel development.

##### Note

  The execution environment must include:  
  fp1 development directory (The configuration part and hardware are mandatory, and other options are optional.)  
  SDx development tool  
  SDAccel hardware

2. Configure the execution environment.

  Run the **huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/setup.sh** script to configure the hardware development environment.

  	cd huaweicloud-fpga/fp1
  	export SW_FPGA_DIR=$(pwd)
  	source $SW_FPGA_DIR/setup.sh
##### Note

  For details, see the configuration environment part of the README file in the **huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/** directory.

3.  Go to the directory where the host application is located.

    cd $SW_FPGA_DIR/software/app/sdaccel_app

4. Compile host.

  Go to the directory where the example host is located and run the **make** command to generate the executable file mmult.

  	cd $SW_FPGA_DIR/software/app/sdaccel_app/mmult_hls
  	make

##### Note

  Host programs for different examples compiled:  
  mmult_hls example: The host program is mmult.  
  vadd_cl example: The host program is vadd.  
  vadd_rtl example: The host program is vadd.

5. Perform the hardware test.

  Run the **run.sh** command to load and test hardware. The detailed procedure is as follows:

  	cd $SW_FPGA_DIR/software/app/sdaccel_app/mmult_hls
  	sh run.sh mmult $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/examples/mmult_hls/prj/bin/bin_mmult_hw.xclbin 0

The 0 at the end of the above run.sh script indicates the slot number, which is obtained when the user requests the environment. 
For example, if a user applies for a virtual machine environment with 4 FPGA accelerator cards, the slot numbers are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

##### Note

  For details about how to use **run.sh**, run **sh run.sh -h**.
