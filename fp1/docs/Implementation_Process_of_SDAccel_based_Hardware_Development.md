SDAccel-Based Operation Process
-------------------------

The compilation and execution processes of the SDAccel platform are based on the SDx tool compilation environment and the execution environment that supports FPGA cards.

**Notes**

SDAccel compilation environment and execution environment can be deployed on the same VM.

The SDAccel platform provides two methods for creating a project.

-   Create a project and upload user-developed code to the compilation environment, or develop code on the platform to meet user requirements.

-   Copy an example project, modify parameters, and add user code to meet user requirements.


### User Operation Process

User operation processes include the simulation development process and the hardware development process.

#### The following table describes each step of the user operation process.

Configuring the Development Environment
------------

The SDAccel is stored in the `huaweicloud-fpga/fp1` directory on a VM by default. Configure the hardware development environment before SDAccel development.

#### Step 1 Configure the EDA tool mode.

Open the **setup.cfg** file in the **huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/** directory, and set `FPGA_DEVELOP_MODE` to the required FPGA development tool.

To use SDAccel as a development tool, set the parameter as follows:

`FPGA_DEVELOP_MODE="sdx"`

**Note**
The default development tool is Vivado. Therefore, you need to change Vivado to the selected tool.

#### Step 2 Configure the license file of EDA.

Set `XILINX_LIC_SETUP` in the setup.cfg file to the IP address of the license server.

CN North:
`XILINX_LIC_SETUP="2100@100.125.1.240:2100@100.125.1.245"`

CN South:
`XILINX_LIC_SETUP="2100@100.125.16.137:2100@100.125.16.138"`

CN East:
`XILINX_LIC_SETUP="2100@100.125.17.108:2100@100.125.17.109"`


#### Step 3 Configure the version of EDA.

Set `VIVADO_VER_REQ` in the `setup.cfg` file to the version of the selected tool.

To use SDAccel as a development tool, set the parameter of `VIVADO_VER_REQ` as follows:

`VIVADO_VER_REQ="2017.4.op"`


**Notes**
The default development tool version is 2017.2. Therefore, you need to change 2017.2 to the version of the selected tool.

Only user **root** has the right to use the Xilinx license file provided by Huawei.

#### Step 4 Complete the development environment configuration.

Run the `setup.sh` script to configure the hardware development environment.


`cd huaweicloud-fpga/fp1`  
`export HW_FPGA_DIR=$(pwd)`  
`source $HW_FPGA_DIR/setup.sh`


**Note**
You can copy all the files of SDAccel to any directory on a VM. The following sections use the default directory as an example.

Creating a User Project
------------

By default, user projects are stored in the `$HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdacel_design/user` directory. Run the `create_prj.sh` script to create a project.


`cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user`  
`sh create_prj.sh <usr_prj_name> <kernel_mode>`


**Note**
<usr_prj_name> is the user project name and is specified when users create a project. <kernel_mode> is the user project type, and users can select `temp_cl, temp_c, or temp_rtl`. For details, see `$HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdacel_design/user/README.md`.

<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>
Implementing SDAccel-Based Development
-----------
1. SDAccel supports OpenCL/C/Verilog/VHDL for kernel development. The source files must be stored in the `$HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/src` directory of the `<usr_prj_name>` directory.
2. After the compilation is complete, modify the Makefile in the `$HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/src` directory of `<usr_prj_name>`, and modify variables `HOST_EXE=User host program name` and `KERNEL_NAME=Kernel name compiled by the user`.
3. After the Makefile is modified, go to the `$HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/scripts/` directory and run `sh compile.sh hw` to complete the compilation and generate the executable files of the host program and the .xclbin file.

**Note**
The name of kernel compiled by users must be the same as the name of the kernel module.  

**Each compilation clears the previously compiled contents. Back up the compiled files before a new compilation.**

<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>
Implementing SDAccel-Based Simulation
-----------

SDAccel supports the cpu-emulation and hw-emulation simulation modes.

#### Step 1 Develop host and kernel code.

`cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/src`

The code must be stored in the **src** directory.

#### Step 2 Configure compilation scripts.

`cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/src`

Configure host and kernel names in the Makefile file.

#### Step 3 Implement simulation compilation.

`cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/scripts`  
`sh compile.sh <emulation_mode>`

#### Step 4 Implement the simulation.


`cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/scripts`  
`sh run.sh emu ../prj/bin/<example_host> ../prj/bin/<xclbin>`


**Note**
For details about how to implement the simulation, see `HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/README.md`.

<a id="sec-6" name="sec-6"></a>
Configuring a Project
--------

SDAccel supports one-click project building. Modify the `Makefile` file in the `$HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/SDAccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/src/` directory to configure a project.

#### The configuration items include:

-   Host name

-   Kernel name

<a id="sec-7" name="sec-7"></a>
Version Compilation
------------

Run the `compile.sh` script to compile, link, and generate the host program, and to compile the kernel, implement synthesis, placing, and routing, and generate the target file.


`cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/scripts/`  
`sh compile.sh hw`


**Note**
For details, see `HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/README.md`.  

**Each compilation clears the previously compiled contents. Back up the compiled files before a new compilation.**

<a id="sec-8" name="sec-8"></a>
Example of Using the xclbinsplit Tool
------------


```bash
cd $HW_FPGA_DIR/hardware/sdaccel_design/user/<usr_prj_name>/prj/bin
/software/Xilinx/SDx_2017.4_op/SDx/2017.4.op/runtime/bin/xclbinsplit bin_mmult_hw.xclbin
mv split-primary.bit split-primary.dcp
```

##### Notes:

You need to adjust the path of the xclbinsplit tool based on the VM environment.

You need to change the xclbin file names based on the actual situation.
